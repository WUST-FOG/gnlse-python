GNLSE: Nonlinear optics modeling tool for optical fibers
========================================================

gnlse-python is a Python set of scripts for solving Generalized Nonlinear
Schrodinger Equation. It is one of the WUST-FOG students projects developed by
`Fiber Optics Group, WUST <http://www.fog.pwr.edu.pl/>`_.

Installation
------------

 1. Create a virtual environment using ``python -m venv gnlse`` or ``conda``.
 2. Activate it:

    ``. gnlse/bin/activate``

 3. Clone the GitHub repository:

    ``git clone https://github.com/WUST-FOG/gnlse-python.git``

 4. Install the package with all requirements:

    ``pip install .``

    or add the relevant path to your ``PYTHONPATH`` enviroment variable.

Dependencies
************

The following Python packages are required to install gnlse module. During
instalation of package the latest version of each of listed below package will
automatically be installed if missing:

::

  matplotlib>=2.2.2
  numpy>=1.14.3
  scipy>=1.1.0
  pyfftw>=0.10.0
  hdf5storage>=0.1.15
  tqdm>=4.11.2

Usage
-----

We provide some example Python scripts in the ``examples`` subdirectory. For
instance, running ``test_Dudley.py`` demonstrates supercontinuum generation in
an optical fiber using three different input pulse envelopes.

::

  cd gnlse-python/examples
  python test_Dudley.py

A visualisation, pictured in the screenshot below, is then displayed.

More examples can be found in the `examples subdirectory 
<https://github.com/WUST-FOG/gnlse-python/tree/master/examples>`_.

Major features
--------------

  * **A modular design**: the solver framework was decomposed into different
    components and one can easily construct a customized simulations by
    accounting different physical phenomena, ie. self stepening,
    Raman response.

    The main core of the module is derived from the RK4IP MATLAB script
    written by J. C. Travers, H. Frosz and J. M. Dudley, published [DT10]_.

  * Support for three Raman response functions: ``blowwood`` [BW89]_,
    ``linagrawal`` [LA06]_ and ``hollenbeck`` [HC02]_.
  * Support for two dispersion operators: calculated from a Taylor expansion
    and calculated from effective refractive indices.
  * A number of example scripts in the ``examples`` subdirectory:

     * ``plot_input_pulse.py``, plotting various input pulse envelopes,
     * ``plot_Raman_response.py``, plotting supported Raman response functions
       in the time domain,
     * ``test_3rd_order_soliton.py``, demonstrating the evolution of spectral
       and temporal characteristics of a third-order soliton,
     * ``test_dispersion.py``, an example of supercontinuum generation using
       different dispersion operators,
     * ``test_nonlinearity.py``, an example of supercontinuum generation using
       different GNLSE and M-GNLSE
       (take into account mode profile dispersion),  
     * ``test_Dudley``, an example of supercontinuum generation using
       different input pulse envelopes,
     * ``test_gvd``, showing pulse broadening due to group velocity
       dispersion,
     * ``test_import_export.py``, an example of saving and loading simulation
       results to and from a \*.mat file.
     * ``test_raman.py``, showing solition fission in case for different Raman
       responses,
     * ``test_spm``, an example of self-phase modulation,
     * ``test_spm+gvd``, demonstrating generation of a first-order soliton.
