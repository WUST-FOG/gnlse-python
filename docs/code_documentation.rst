GNLSE package documentation
===========================

Pulse envelopes
-----------------

This module allows one to model proper input envelope as the given initial
conditions to solve Generalized Nonlinear Schrodiner Equation (GNLSE).

GNLSE model
-----------

This part of the module is its core, and it implements the split-step Fourier
method to solve the GNLSE.

Dispersion operators
--------------------

Package supports two dispersion operators: calculated from a Taylor expansion
and calculated from effective refractive indices.

   gnlse.DispersionFiberFromInterpolation

Nonlinear coefficient
---------------------

The guided fiber mode has a certain effective mode area, which in general
depends on frequency. Package supports two possibilites to account
the parameter: by giving the scalar value for gamma at central wavelength
or calculated values for freqency range from effective refractive indices
and effective mode area (experimantal or simulated data)
Mode profile dispersion in GNLSE is accounted based on algorithm
described in [J07]_.

Raman responses
---------------

Package supports three Raman response functions: ``blowwood`` [BW89]_,
``linagrawal`` [LA06]_ and ``hollenbeck`` [HC02]_.

Visualisation
-------------

Various plotting functions for visualizing GNLSE simulations using Matplotlib
library are prepared.

   gnlse.quick_plot

Importing and exporting
-----------------------

The following functions allow one to read and write data as \\*.mat files.
