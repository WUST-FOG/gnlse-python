Impulse envelopes
=================

In physics, the envelope of an oscillating signal is a smooth curve
outlining its extremes. The given envelope function is a function of time of
input impulse. The below figure illustrates a modulated waves varying between
an upper and a lower envelope of three types of optical signal.
