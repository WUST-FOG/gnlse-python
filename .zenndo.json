    "description": "<p>The propagation of pulses in optical fibers is described by the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation (GNLSE), which takes into account the fiber losses, nonlinear effects, and higher-order chromatic dispersion. The GNLSE is a partial differential equation, whose order depends on the accounted nonlinear and dispersion effects. We present gnlse-python, an nonlinear optics modeling toolbox that contains a rich set of components and modules to solve GNLSE using the split-step Fourier transform method (SSFM). The numerical solver is freely available, implemented in Python language and includes a number of optical fiber analysis tools.</p>",
